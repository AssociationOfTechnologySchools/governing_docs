In an effort to increase transparency and consistency amongst its participants, the ATS requires that each of its member organizations clarify how they calculate important, key performance indicators. This is especially vital in the area of reporting job outcomes of each member organizations' graduates.

Each member of the Association of Technology Schools must publish on a publicly accessible section of their website definitions for the following terms:

* **Graduation Requirements** - from a curriculum and competency standpoint, what requirements does the member organization require its graduates to complete successfully in order to qualify themselves as a job seeker?
* **Job Seeker** - what qualifies a graduate as someone that is seeking a position following graduation?
* **Placement** - what qualifies as a successful placement following graduation of the program?
* **Placement Rate** - how is the placement rate calculated?
* **Placement Rate Period** - when does the measurement of the placement rate begin and end for each cohort?
* **Average Salary** - how is the average salary calculated?
